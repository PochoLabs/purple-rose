## Want your own Static website?

You can contact me at [celso@pocholabs](mailto:celso@pocholabs) about your project.

Not all organizations need a WordPress website or a server backend. If you think your business or organization can leverage the simplicity of static website, we'd love to talk!

## How do I know if I can use a static website?

- I don't need (or have the capacity) to constantly make edits.
- I don't need a blog hosted on the same domain OR I have a blog hosted on a subdomain
- I'm on a budget, I would rather not pay for hosting.
